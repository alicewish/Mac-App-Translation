.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBbbedit\fR [ \fB\-bchlpsuvVw \-\-(long_form_switches)\fR ] 
    [ \fB\-e\fR \fI<encoding_name>\fR ] [ \fB\-m\fR \fI<language_name>\fR ] [ \fB\-t\fR \fI<string>\fR ] 
    [ \fB+\fR\fI<n>\fR ] [ \fIfile\fR (or) \fI<S/FTP \s-1UR\s0gt\fR ... ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBbbedit\fR tool is a simple utility that allows you to open files in
BBEdit via the command line. Type 'bbedit' followed by a list of file
names to open the specified files for editing in BBEdit.
.PP
In addition to files, you can also specify \s-1FTP\s0 or \s-1SFTP\s0 URLs to files or
directories, to have BBEdit open the specified files, or an \s-1FTP/SFTP\s0
browser for each directory.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        [Not all file switches are supported when using the bbedit tool 
\&        with URLs. This includes line number jumping, \-\-encoding, 
\&        \-\-print.]
.Ve
.PP
When constructing a \s-1URL,\s0 use the standard convention of
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    [s]ftp://<user>:<password>@<host>[:<port>]/directory\-path
.Ve
.PP
for a home-relative path, and
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    [s]ftp://<user>:<password>@<host>[:<port>]//directory\-path
.Ve
.PP
for an absolute path. (You may include or omit the password; BBEdit will 
prompt you for it if necessary.)
.PP
For example, to open a local file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        bbedit ~/myfile.txt
.Ve
.PP
To open a file from a remote server via \s-1FTP:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        bbedit ftp://a_user@server.example.com/path/to/file.txt
.Ve
.PP
To open an \s-1FTP/SFTP\s0 Browser for a remote server directory via \s-1SFTP:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        bbedit sftp://a_user@server.example.com//Users/a_user/
.Ve
.PP
You can also pipe stdin to the \fBbbedit\fR tool, and it will open in a new
untitled window in BBEdit. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ls \-la | bbedit
.Ve
.PP
If you invoke the \fBbbedit\fR tool with no parameters, it will accept
stdin from the terminal; terminate with control-D (end-of-file) to send
it to BBEdit.
.PP
The \fBbbedit\fR tool is also suitable for use as your \s-1EDITOR\s0 environment
variable. See the \fB\-w\fR option below for details.
.PP
BBEdit is a commercial text editor from Bare Bones Software.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Single-character switches may be clustered together. For example, the
following two commands are equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        bbedit \-bp filename
\&        bbedit \-b \-p filename
.Ve
.PP
Use \*(L"\-\-\*(R" to end switch parsing. For example, to open a file named \*(L"\-z\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        bbedit \-\- \-z
.Ve
.PP
Most arguments have both a single-character short form (preceded by one
dash), and a long form (preceded by two dashes).
.PP
The switches \*(L"\-\-front\-window\*(R", \*(L"\-\-new\-window\*(R", and \*(L"\-\-separate\-windows\*(R"
are mutually exclusive: you may only specify one for a given invocation
of the tool. In addition to controlling how BBEdit handles opened files,
these switches apply when creating files and when piping to the tool,
but are ignored for \s-1URL\s0 arguments.
.IP "\fB+\fR<\fIline number\fR>, filename\fB:\fR<\fIline number\fR>" 5
.IX Item "+<line number>, filename:<line number>"
Go to line number. For example, to select line 33:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        bbedit +33 filename
\&        bbedit filename:33
.Ve
.Sp
If a character offset specification (\*(L"filename:33:1\*(R") is additionally 
passed, it will be ignored but the preceding line specification will
be honored.
.Sp
When piping data into \fBbbedit\fR, you can also add a line number
specifier, and BBEdit will place the insertion point at the beginning of
the indicated line, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ls \-la | bbedit +5
.Ve
.Sp
will select the fifth line of text in the text document. (Using
\&\fB\-\-append\fR or \fB\-\-prepend\fR is allowed, but works at cross purposes: the
indicated line in the document will be selected, irrespective of whether
it's in the piped data or not.)
.IP "\fB\-\-append\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--append (no short variant)"
BBEdit will append piped data to the active text document (or worksheet,
if you use \fB\-\-worksheet\fR). If the active document is not of the appropriate
type, BBEdit will create a new document and place the piped data in it.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-background\fR" 5
.IX Item "-b, --background"
Launch BBEdit in the background if it's not already running, or keep it
in the background if it is. If this option is absent, BBEdit will come
to the foreground after the files are opened.
.IP "\fB\-\-clean\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--clean (no short variant)"
Piped data will be placed in an untitled document whose state is
initially clean (unmodified) so that if you do not further edit 
the data, you can close the document without confirmation.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-create\fR" 5
.IX Item "-c, --create"
Create the specified files, unless they exist already, in which case
they are opened. The new files are created empty, with the standard Unix
type and creator (i.e. none). Line endings are determined by the
Default Line Breaks option in the Text Files preference panel. (Use 
the \fB\-u\fR option to force Unix line endings.)
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-encoding\fR" 5
.IX Item "-e, --encoding"
Specify the internet name of an encoding to open a file using that
encoding.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        bbedit \-\-encoding iso\-8859\-1 foo.txt
\&        bbedit \-\-encoding utf\-8 foo.txt
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-front\-window\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--front-window (no short variant)"
Opens the specified files as separate documents in the frontmost text
window. If there is no text window open, BBEdit will create one. Note
that use of this option does not affect the contents of any document
already open.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 5
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Display a basic help line with a summary of the available options.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-launch\fR" 5
.IX Item "-l, --launch"
Launch BBEdit (or activate it, if it's already running), without opening
any files.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-language\fR" 5
.IX Item "-m, --language"
Specify the source language of the document to be created when piping output in.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        some_process | bbedit \-\-language Ruby
\&        some_process | bbedit \-m JSON
.Ve
.Sp
You may also use an Emacs mode name that maps to your designated
language (this can easily be generated by converting the language name
to lower case and replacing spaces with dashes):
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        some_process | bbedit \-\-language object\-pascal
\&        some_process | bbedit \-m json
.Ve
.Sp
(Historical note: \fB\-l\fR was already taken, which is why we didn't use it
here. If it helps, you can use the mnemonic "\fB\-m\fR is for \fImode\fR".)
.IP "\fB\-\-maketags\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--maketags (no short variant)"
Make (generate) a BBEdit compatible ctags 'tags' file for all eligible 
files in the current directory, or a 'tags' file at the top of each 
directory in a specified list of directories:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bbedit  \-\-maketags  [optional list of dirs]
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-new\-window\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--new-window (no short variant)"
Opens the specified files as separate documents in a new text window.
.IP "\fB\-\-prepend\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--prepend (no short variant)"
BBEdit will prepend piped data to the active text document (or worksheet,
if you use \fB\-\-worksheet\fR). If the active document is not of the appropriate
type, BBEdit will create a new document and place the piped data in it.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\fR" 5
.IX Item "-p, --print"
Print the specified files on your currently selected printer.
.IP "\fB\-\-project\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--project (no short variant)"
Creates a synthetic project (named with \f(CW$CWD\fR) containing the specified
files.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-pipe\-title\fR" 5
.IX Item "-t, --pipe-title"
Uses the specified string as the title of the window which holds the
pipe contents, so you can more easily locate it later.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ls \-al | bbedit \-t "My Directory Listing"
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-create\-unix\fR" 5
.IX Item "-u, --create-unix"
Create the specified files, unless they exist already, in which case
they are opened. New files are created with Unix line endings. This
option is useful if you wish to create a file with Unix line endings,
but have Mac line endings specified as the default for files created
within BBEdit (see the Text Files preferences panel).
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-worksheet\fR" 5
.IX Item "-s, --worksheet"
Create a new shell worksheet file with the specified name, unless such a
file exists already, in which case it will be opened.
.IP "\fB\-\-scratchpad\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--scratchpad (no short variant)"
Appends the data provided on \f(CW$STDIN\fR to the scratchpad.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ls | bbedit \-\-scratchpad
\&
\&    bbedit \-\-scratchpad < example.log
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-separate\-windows\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--separate-windows (no short variant)"
Opens each of the specified files into its own text window.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 5
.IX Item "-v, --version"
Display the current version number of the \fBbbedit\fR command line tool
and the BBEdit application.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-short\-version\fR" 5
.IX Item "-V, --short-version"
Display the short-form version number of the \fBbbedit\fR command line
tool.
.IP "\fB\-\-view\-top\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--view-top (no short variant)"
Piped data will be placed into a new document which will have its
scrollbar positioned at the top rather than the end (the default
behavior).
.IP "\fB\-\-resume\fR (no short variant)" 5
.IX Item "--resume (no short variant)"
Used in combination with \-w or \-\-wait, this switch will cause the
application which was frontmost when the bbedit tool was invoked to be
made frontmost again once you close the file(s) specified on the command
line.
.Sp
This is convenient if you are using the Terminal (or any third-party
equivalent) to invoke a command which uses BBEdit as its editor (p4,
cvs), and want to return back to the Terminal when the editing session
is over.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        bbedit \-\-wait \-\-resume  ~/foo.txt
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wait\fR" 5
.IX Item "-w, --wait"
Wait until the file is closed in BBEdit. Normally, the bbedit tool exits
immediately after the file arguments are opened in BBEdit. This option
applies to both local files and files opened from \s-1FTP\s0 or \s-1SFTP\s0 servers.
.Sp
The \-w option allows the bbedit tool to be used as an external editor
for Unix tools that use the \s-1EDITOR\s0 global environment variable. To make
this work using tcsh, add the following line to your .cshrc (or .tcshrc)
file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        setenv EDITOR "bbedit \-w"
.Ve
.Sp
Some tools (notably \fBcrontab\fR), will not work correctly if your \s-1EDITOR\s0
variable consists of multiple terms. You can work around this by
creating a simple shell script that calls \fBbbedit \-w\fR, then using the
shell script as your \s-1EDITOR.\s0 For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        #!/bin/sh
\&        bbedit \-w "$@"
